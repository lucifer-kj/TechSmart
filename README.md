## ServiceM8 Customer Portal

A secure, self-service customer portal for ServiceM8 users to view job status, approve quotes, download documents, and track payments. Built with Next.js (App Router) and Supabase, integrated with the ServiceM8 API and real-time webhooks.

### Why itâ€™s useful
- **Reduce back-and-forth**: Customers can self-serve job info, invoices, and approvals.
- **Faster approvals**: Digital quote approval with signature speeds up job kickoff.
- **Single source of truth**: Data syncs from ServiceM8 and is cached for performance.
- **Secure access**: Customer-specific isolation and audit logging.

### Who uses it
- **Customers**: View their jobs, download invoices/quotes, approve quotes, check payment status.
- **Internal staff (optional)**: Monitor customer activity and sync status via Supabase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Supabase account and project
- A ServiceM8 account with API access (optional for development)

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd servicem8
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your actual values
   ```

3. **Check your environment setup:**
   ```bash
   npm run check-env
   ```

4. **Seed development data (optional):**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` â€“ Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` â€“ Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` â€“ Supabase service role key

**Optional (for ServiceM8 integration):**
- `SERVICEM8_API_KEY` â€“ ServiceM8 API key (automatically detects company info)
- `SERVICEM8_WEBHOOK_SECRET` â€“ Webhook secret for production

**Smart Features:**
- **Auto-Detection**: ServiceM8 company info is automatically fetched from your API key
- **Mock Data Fallback**: If no API key is provided, uses realistic mock data for development
- **Multi-Account Support**: Works with any ServiceM8 account by simply changing the API key
- **Graceful Degradation**: Authentication failures fall back to mock data in development mode

### ServiceM8 Integration

The app works with **any ServiceM8 account** by simply providing an API key:

1. **Get your ServiceM8 API key** from your ServiceM8 account settings
2. **Add it to your environment**:
   ```bash
   SERVICEM8_API_KEY=your_servicem8_api_key
   ```
3. **That's it!** The app automatically:
   - Detects your company information
   - Fetches your real ServiceM8 data
   - Configures itself for your account

ðŸ“– **Detailed Setup Guide**: See [ServiceM8 Setup Guide](docs/SERVICEM8_SETUP.md)

### Quick Verification

1. **Check environment setup:**
   ```bash
   npm run check-env
   ```

2. **Test the dashboard:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
   - You should see the dashboard with your ServiceM8 data (or mock data if no API key)

3. **Test API endpoints:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/servicem8/jobs` to see JSON output
   - Use `?customerId=YOUR_COMPANY_UUID` to test with different customers
