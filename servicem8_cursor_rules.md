# ServiceM8 Customer Portal - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
A secure customer portal for ServiceM8 users to view job status, download documents, approve quotes, and track payments. Built with Next.js, integrated with ServiceM8 API, and hosted on Vercel.

## Instructions

- Record fixes for mistakes or corrections to avoid repetition in the `Lessons` section.
- Organize thoughts and plan steps before starting a task in the `Scratchpad` section.
- Clear old tasks if necessary.
- Use todo markers for progress tracking:
  - `[X]` Completed tasks
  - `[ ]` Pending tasks
- Update Scratchpad after completing subtasks.
- Reflect and plan after milestones for better task management.
- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.
- Follow security-first approach for all customer data handling.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js/Next.js 15+ with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (serverless)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Integration**: ServiceM8 API
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **File Uploads**: Uploadthing (for document handling)

## Lessons

1. **ServiceM8 API Integration**:
   - Always use proper error handling for ServiceM8 API calls as they can be rate-limited
   - Store ServiceM8 webhooks data immediately in Supabase to avoid data loss
   - Use incremental sync for large datasets to prevent timeouts

2. **Next.js 15+ Specific**:
   - Use `npx shadcn@latest add [component]` for Shadcn UI components
   - Page props params must be typed as Promise:
     ```typescript
     type tParams = Promise<{ id: string }>
     interface PageProps {
       params: tParams
     }
     ```
   - Always await params: `const { id } = await props.params`

3. **Authentication & Security**:
   - Use `const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()` for Supabase Auth
   - Implement customer-specific data isolation in database queries
   - Always validate customer access to job data before serving

4. **Database & Supabase**:
   - Use Row Level Security (RLS) for customer data protection
   - Implement proper indexing for job queries by customer_id
   - Cache frequently accessed ServiceM8 data locally to reduce API calls

5. **File Handling**:
   - Use Uploadthing for secure document uploads/downloads
   - Implement proper file type validation for invoices/quotes
   - Store file metadata in Supabase, actual files in Uploadthing

6. **Build & Lint Fixes (2025-09-16)**:
   - For NextAuth v4 in App Router, export handlers with `export const { GET, POST } = NextAuth(authOptions)` and use `getServerSession(authOptions)` for `auth()` in server code
   - Replace `<img>` with `next/image` for optimized LCP and bandwidth
   - Remove unused imports and explicitly void unused parameters to satisfy ESLint without disabling rules
   - Ensure API route files export valid `GET/POST` to avoid Turbopack ‚Äúhandlers undefined‚Äù build error

## ServiceM8 API Best Practices

- Always handle rate limits gracefully (20,000 requests/day limit)
- Cache frequently accessed data locally
- Use webhooks for real-time updates instead of polling
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Test with ServiceM8 sandbox environment first
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Keep API credentials secure and rotate regularly
- Use X-API-Key header for authentication
- Implement exponential backoff for 429 responses
- Batch requests where possible to optimize performance

## ServiceM8 API Implementation Details

### Required API Endpoints:
- **Companies**: `/company.json`, `/company/{uuid}.json`
- **Jobs**: `/job.json`, `/job/{uuid}.json`, `/job.json?$filter=company_uuid eq '{uuid}'`
- **Job Materials**: `/jobmaterial.json?$filter=job_uuid eq '{uuid}'`
- **Attachments**: `/attachment.json?$filter=related_object_uuid eq '{uuid}'`, `/attachment/{uuid}.json?$attachment`
- **Job Activities**: `/jobactivity.json?$filter=job_uuid eq '{uuid}'`

### Key ServiceM8 Fields:
- **Company**: uuid, name, email, mobile, address, active, date_created, date_last_modified
- **Job**: uuid, job_number, company_uuid, job_description, status, generated_job_total, job_address, date_created, date_last_modified
- **JobMaterial**: uuid, job_uuid, name, description, qty, cost_ex_tax, total_ex_tax, total_inc_tax
- **Attachment**: uuid, related_object_uuid, file_name, file_type, attachment_source, date_created, file_size
- **JobActivity**: uuid, job_uuid, activity_type, start_date, end_date, staff_uuid, notes

### Webhook Events:
- `job.updated` - Job status changes
- `attachment.created` - New documents/photos
- `jobmaterial.updated` - Line item changes

## Notes

- Customer data isolation is critical - always filter by customer_id
- ServiceM8 API has rate limits - implement proper caching
- File uploads should be validated and scanned for security
- All customer actions should be logged for audit purposes
- Performance is key - customers expect fast load times
- Mobile experience is crucial for field workers and customers
